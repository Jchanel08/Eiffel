***

This is a starter kit that includes the basic setup for a web-ready optimized static website. It is build on Middleman, a static site generator that runs on Ruby to allow for partials, layouts, frontmatter, livereloading (for development) and extensions that can be installed for even more functionality. Middleman also supports a lightweight blog system that can be turned on manually (not natively enabled at this time in Eiffel).

The benefit of using a static site generator is that it gives you a clean enviroment to write your content and a flexible system for your HTML, CSS, and JS. Run Middleman in a development enviroment to enable livereloading so that your preview of your website updates every time you save a file. When you're ready to deploy, simply run the build command in Middleman for a compiled and optimized version of your website, ready for upload via FTP, or you can use GitHub to host your site, or use a service like Netlify to allow for instant builds of your site every time you push to Github.

Eiffel adds some basic configurations of Middleman to help it work exactly as listed and includes placeholder content for SEO meta tags and SCSS configuration with variables and mixins.

Work in Progress, expanded documentation and features coming soon.
